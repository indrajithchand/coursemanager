You will get there by learning about major topics like how you can correctly interact with your API by using the correct HTTP methods & status codes, method safety and idempotency, validation, common features like paging, sorting, filtering and data shaping, and supporting HATEOAS, versioning, caching and concurrency. By the end of this course, you will be able to build an API with level 3 maturity, which is the highest possible level for APIs. Before you begin, make sure you are already familiar with C# and know a thing or two about building APIs with ASP.NET Core." , PreRequisites = ".NET Framework, C#", Level=1},
